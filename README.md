## App Guide - An application for helping people to use the different apps easily!!!
Hey guys, I am developing an android app to help people use different apps like Paytm, Ola, Uber, etc. As a huge number of people like many of our parents don't know how to operate all such apps, and they need to depend on us, to help them out I am developing an application in which there will be a pictorial guide for basic and needy operations like booking a cab, online payment, recharge, etc.

**For that, I Need A Proper Guide Manual.**

Are you guys looking forward to contributing to this Hacktoberfest? Or start your journey for open-source contribution?
